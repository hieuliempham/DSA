# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) - Animated Examples for Faster Learning

Welcome to the **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** project! This repository is designed to help programmers and students understand and master key DSA concepts through **animated examples** and **step-by-step explanations**. Whether you're preparing for coding interviews, taking a DSA course, or just curious about how things work under the hood, this project is for you.

## 📖 Topics Covered

### **Technical Concepts**
- **Big O Notation**  
  Understand time and space complexity to analyze the efficiency of algorithms.

### **Data Structures**
- **Arrays**  
  Learn how arrays store data contiguously and how to manipulate them effectively.
- **Vectors**  
  Explore dynamic arrays in C++ with resizable capabilities.
- **Linked Lists**  
  Understand the pros and cons of singly linked lists.
- **Doubly Linked Lists**  
  Extend linked lists with bidirectional traversal.
- **Stacks & Queues**  
  Learn LIFO (Last In First Out) and FIFO (First In First Out) data management.
- **Binary Trees**  
  Visualize hierarchical data structures and their operations.
- **Hash Tables**  
  Explore key-value pair storage and collision handling.
- **Graphs**  
  Represent and traverse connected nodes using adjacency matrices and lists.

### **Algorithms**
#### **Sorting Algorithms**
- **Bubble Sort**  
  Compare adjacent elements and sort iteratively.
- **Selection Sort**  
  Find the minimum element and place it at the beginning.
- **Insertion Sort**  
  Insert elements into a sorted portion of the list.
- **Merge Sort**  
  Divide and conquer with recursive merging.
- **Quick Sort**  
  Partition around a pivot and sort recursively.

#### **Searching Algorithms**
- **Breadth First Search (BFS)**  
  Explore layer by layer for graph traversal.
- **Depth First Search (DFS)**  
  Dive deep into branches before backtracking.
